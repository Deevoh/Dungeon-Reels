# Dungeon Reels

Another personal project of mine. Thought that making a hybrid RPG and slot machine game would be a decent challenge to attempt and something I can look back on and rebuild in the future. It would also be neat to utilize this code once I learn more about using graphical libraries.


## **To Do**

- Implement random enemies and looping through them.
- Implement escape mechanic.
- Implement XP and leveling up.
- Implement high score system.
- Fix the scoring check functions so the print statements properly display for singular/plural matches.
- Fix the armor reduction and scaling as per each enemy attack and armor match.
- Add a chance for random events.
- Needs extensive balancing and playtesting.
