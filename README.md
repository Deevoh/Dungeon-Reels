# Dungeon Reels

Another personal project of mine. Thought that making a hybrid RPG and slot machine game would be a decent challenge to attempt and something I can look back on and rebuild in the future. It would also be neat to utilize this code once I learn more about using graphical libraries.


## **To Do**

- Scale armor and health buffs with player level.
- Scale enemies with player level.
- Add in dungeon levels, and a chance for bosses after a certain amount of enemies defeated.
- Add a chance for random events.
- Add more player interaction.
- Needs extensive balancing and playtesting.
