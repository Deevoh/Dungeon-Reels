# Dungeon Reels

Another personal project of mine. Thought that making a hybrid RPG and slot machine game would be a decent challenge to attempt and something I can look back on and rebuild in the future. It would also be neat to utilize this code once I learn more about using graphical libraries.


## **To Do**

- Improve player/enemy status readability.
- Add option to rest after battle or regain TP or buff armor.
- Add a chance for random events.
- Add more player interaction.
- Needs extensive balancing and playtesting.
