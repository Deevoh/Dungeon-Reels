# Dungeon Reels

Another personal project of mine. I thought that making a hybrid RPG and slot machine game would be a decent challenge to attempt and something I can learn from, look back on, and rebuild in the future.

Delve as far as you can into the dungeon while defeating enemies and bosses along the way. The outcome of combat is determined by spinning reels in a slot machine mechanic. There are different actions that can happen when certain symbols match in either a row or column. Your final score is determined by numerous things including defeated enemy and boss counts, player level and XP, and total accumulated symbol matches. There are also final scoring penalties for fleeing a battle early and player death.


## **To Do**

- Improve player/enemy status readability.
- Add option to rest after battle or regain TP or buff armor.
- Add a chance for random events.
- Add more player interaction.
- Needs extensive balancing and playtesting.
- Rebuild using pygame.
